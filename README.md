This repository contains implementations of the following algorithm:
These are my entries for a competition I took part in whilst working for The Hut Group and was all coded up over the course of a few nights after work.

* Read a filename from STDIN
* Read the contents of the file
* For each word in the contents, if the following word is an alphabetic representation of a number from 1 to 10 then repeat the current word n times where n is the numeric of the following word
* Count the occurrences of each word and then output to STDOUT the count and word sorted by frequency and then reverse sorted by word alphabetically.

Current working solutions are:

* BASH
* C++
* Golang
* Java
* Javascript
* Perl
* PHP
* Python (including a one-liner)
* Ruby

I would like to include in the future:

* C
* Haskell
* Lingua::Romana::Perligata
* Rust
* Common Lisp
* LOLCODE
